1    The Fence \\n \\nTom Sawyer lived with his aunt because his mother and \\nfather were dead.

One Friday, he didn’t go to school—he went to the river. \\nAunt Polly was angry. “You’re a bad boy!” she said. \\n“Tomorrow you can’t play with your friends because you didn’t go to school today. Tomorrow you’re going to work for me. You can paint the fence.” \\nSaturday morning, Tom was not happy, but he started to \\npaint the fence. His friend Jim was in the street. \\nTom asked him, “Do you want to paint?” \\nJim said, “No, I can’t. I’m going to get water.” \\nThen Ben came to Tom’s house. He watched Tom and \\nsaid, “I’m going to swim today. You can’t swim because you’re working.” \\nTom said, “This isn’t work. I like painting.” \\n“Can I paint, too?” Ben asked. \\n“No, you can’t,” Tom answered. “Aunt Polly asked me \\nbecause I’m a very good painter.” \\nBen said, “I’m a good painter, too. Please, can I paint? I \\nhave some fruit. Do you want it?” \\nOK,” Tom said. “Give me the fruit. Then you can paint.” \\nBen started to paint the fence. Later, many boys came to \\nTom’s house.
